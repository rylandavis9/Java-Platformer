# Java Platformer
Based on my RPG engine and map editor bored on flight and made this without internet.

Spent approx 5-6 hours total on project between flights and car ride. Probably about an hour was spent on trying to make the map and figure that out. Lots of borrowed code from the RPG, but had to change a lot due to the nature of the two genres. Very basic and not great platformer but with no engine it's solid especially for the time spent. Probably wont work much more on this one for now.
